### Hi there 👋

I'm a first-year CS PHD student in **Northwestern University**.

My research focus on System Security(kernel, cloud, user-space programs and etc.).

Before joining Northwestern as a PHD student, I had a great time for security research in Northwestern S&P Group and Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab.

I also play CTF, as a Pwner, especially on kernel pwn.

I like vulnerability exploitation, also trying to learn program repair and static analysis.

I randomly submit some bugs/vulnerabilities reports to community.
