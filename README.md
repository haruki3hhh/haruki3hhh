### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first-year CS PHD student in **Northwestern University**.

My research focus on System Security(kernel, cloud, user-space programs and etc.).

Before joining Northwestern as a PHD Student, I had great time for security research in Tencent Xuanwu Lab and NU S&P Group.

I also play CTF, as a Pwner, especially on kernel.

I like vulnerability exploitation, also trying to learn program repair and static analysis.
